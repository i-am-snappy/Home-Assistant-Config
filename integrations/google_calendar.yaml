# Google Calendar Event
# The google calendar platform allows you to connect to your Google Calendars and generate binary sensors.
# The sensors created can trigger based on any event on the calendar or only for matching events.
# When you first setup this integration it will generate a new configuration file google_calendars.yaml
# in your configuration directory that will contain information about all of the calendars you can see.
# It also exposes a service to add an event to one of your Google Calendars.
